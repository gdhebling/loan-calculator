# New Loan Calculator
## Take Home Task
### About
This is a web application for simulating the calculation of different loans.  
You can select among Annuity Loan or Serial Loan types, and between the Loan Objectice, which will alter the interest rate percentage. The application will then return the report according to the loan type. For the Serial Loan, it will also return an amortisation schedule table.

### Technologies Used  
HTML5, SCSS/CSS3, and JavaScript.
### Requirements
The application is expected to calculate the cost of a housing loan, with a simple interface, where the user can specify the desired loan amount and the payback time in years.  
  
The **Loan Type** selector alters which formula the program will use, while the **Loan Goal** selector changes the interest rate that will be used for the calculation.  
So the idea is that it could easily be extended to cover other types of loans and payback schemes.  
 
## That's it!
