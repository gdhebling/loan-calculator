## Take Home Task
### Edit 12.11.2020: 
Please refer to the new version of this app at https://github.com/gdhebling/loan-calculator/tree/new-version
### About
This is a simple web application for simulating the calculation of different loans.  
You can select among Annuity Loan or Serial Loan types and the website will return if some average payment values.

### Technologies Used  
HTML5, SCSS/CSS3, and JavaScript.
### Requirements
The application is expected to calculate the cost of a housing loan, with a simple interface, where the user can specify the desired loan amount and the payback time in years.  
  
The **Loan Type** selector alters which formula the program will use, while the **Loan Goal** selector changes the interest rate that will be used for the calculation.  
So the idea is that it could easily be extended to cover other types of loans and payback schemes.  
  
Due to *technical difficulties*, the application is not, for the moment, returning the full amortisation schedule.

### Other
Please don't hesitate to get in touch in case there is anything I could contribute to the talk. Being part of this take-home was a great and motivating experience and I would be glad to continue our conversation.
